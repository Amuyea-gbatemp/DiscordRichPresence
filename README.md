# Discord Rich Presence
#### By Auax

This project aims to have an easy and quick configuration, 
so you can change the Discord Status at any time once you have configured it.

With this repository, you can change the Discord status, and set your own!
Here are the detailed steps:

1) First head to https://discord.com/developers/applications and log in with your account, 
and click the `"New Application button"`

2) A window will pop-up, choose your application name (you can change it later), and save.
  

- Once you've done that, you'll be redirected to your application dashboard, 
  here you need to copy your `CLIENT ID` (you'll need it later).

and select your image. (Remember the name you set for the image, you'll need it later).

### That's all you need to configure in the Discord Developer Portal

5) Now, head to the `config.json` file, located inside the repository folder. 
Configure the file as you want. Don't forget to replace the `clientID` value with the 
  one you copied before from the Discord Developer Portal. *(Don't forget to save the changes).*
   

6) Once everything is done, run the ***discord_status.py*** file (with the Discord Launcher opened), 
   and you should see the changes.
